<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer Graduate Computing Student Intern</strong> June 2023 – Aug 2023
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Worked in research and development with the Chimbuko team.
Created scripts to streamline data structure creation from Chimbuko's Provenance Database. Evaluated ML-based methods to predict performance anomalies in Chimbuko Provenance data: created a graph-based representation of performance events and compared classification prediction of GNN models to a state-of-the-art tabular classifier; achieved an accuracy improvement of more than 15% using a GraphSAGE model as compared to XGBoost. Began work to integrate an anomaly detection algorithm from the prior year's work with the current Chimbuko source.
