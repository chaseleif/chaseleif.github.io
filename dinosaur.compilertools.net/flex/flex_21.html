<dl compact="compact">

<dt><samp>`warning, rule cannot be matched'</samp>
</dt><dd>
indicates that the given
rule cannot be matched because it follows other rules that
will always match the same text as it.  For example, in
the following "foo" cannot be matched because it comes
after an identifier "catch-all" rule:

<pre>[a-z]+    got_identifier();
foo       got_foo();
</pre>

Using <code>REJECT</code> in a scanner suppresses this warning.

</dd><dt><samp>`warning, -s option given but default rule can be matched'</samp>
</dt><dd>
means that it is possible (perhaps only in a particular
start condition) that the default rule (match any single
character) is the only one that will match a particular
input.  Since <samp>`-s'</samp> was given, presumably this is not
intended.

</dd><dt><samp>`reject_used_but_not_detected undefined'</samp>
</dt><dd>
</dd><dt><samp>`yymore_used_but_not_detected undefined'</samp>
</dt><dd>
These errors can
occur at compile time.  They indicate that the scanner
uses <code>REJECT</code> or <samp>`yymore()'</samp> but that <code>flex</code> failed to notice the
fact, meaning that <code>flex</code> scanned the first two sections
looking for occurrences of these actions and failed to
find any, but somehow you snuck some in (via a #include
file, for example).  Use <samp>`%option reject'</samp> or <samp>`%option yymore'</samp>
to indicate to flex that you really do use these features.

</dd><dt><samp>`flex scanner jammed'</samp>
</dt><dd>
a scanner compiled with <samp>`-s'</samp> has
encountered an input string which wasn't matched by any of
its rules.  This error can also occur due to internal
problems.

</dd><dt><samp>`token too large, exceeds YYLMAX'</samp>
</dt><dd>
your scanner uses <samp>`%array'</samp>
and one of its rules matched a string longer than the <samp>`YYL-'</samp>
<code>MAX</code> constant (8K bytes by default).  You can increase the
value by #define'ing <code>YYLMAX</code> in the definitions section of
your <code>flex</code> input.

</dd><dt><samp>`scanner requires -8 flag to use the character '<var>x</var>''</samp>
</dt><dd>
Your
scanner specification includes recognizing the 8-bit
character <var>x</var> and you did not specify the -8 flag, and your
scanner defaulted to 7-bit because you used the <samp>`-Cf'</samp> or <samp>`-CF'</samp>
table compression options.  See the discussion of the <samp>`-7'</samp>
flag for details.

</dd><dt><samp>`flex scanner push-back overflow'</samp>
</dt><dd>
you used <samp>`unput()'</samp> to push
back so much text that the scanner's buffer could not hold
both the pushed-back text and the current token in <code>yytext</code>.
Ideally the scanner should dynamically resize the buffer
in this case, but at present it does not.

</dd><dt><samp>`input buffer overflow, can't enlarge buffer because scanner uses REJECT'</samp>
</dt><dd>
the scanner was working on matching an
extremely large token and needed to expand the input
buffer.  This doesn't work with scanners that use <code>REJECT</code>.

</dd><dt><samp>`fatal flex scanner internal error--end of buffer missed'</samp>
</dt><dd>
This can occur in an scanner which is reentered after a
long-jump has jumped out (or over) the scanner's
activation frame.  Before reentering the scanner, use:

<pre>yyrestart( yyin );
</pre>

or, as noted above, switch to using the C++ scanner class.

</dd><dt><samp>`too many start conditions in &lt;&gt; construct!'</samp>
</dt><dd>
you listed
more start conditions in a &lt;&gt; construct than exist (so you
must have listed at least one of them twice).
</dd></dl>
